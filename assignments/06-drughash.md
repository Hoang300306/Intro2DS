# 06-drughash — DrugHash

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | DrugHash (AAAI 2025) |
| **Upstream repository** | https://github.com/nwod-edispu/DrugHash |
| **Benchmarks** | DUD-E and LIT-PCBA |
| **Your directory** | `submissions/06-drughash/` |

You are one of several people, each on a different model. Nothing here depends on anyone else.

## Getting set up

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kongwoang/Intro2DS.git
cd Intro2DS
cp -r submissions/_TEMPLATE submissions/06-drughash
git checkout -b sub/06-drughash
```

**Read [`../CONTRACT.md`](../CONTRACT.md) before you touch a GPU.** It is ten short rules and every
one of them exists because breaking it has already cost somebody a run.

Everything you are told to run is in this repository: `tools/apply_variant.py` builds your variants,
and `scripts/validate_submission.py` is what CI runs on your pull request — run it yourself first,
it is quicker than waiting for CI.

Questions and problems go in a **GitHub issue in this repository**, titled with your id, not a DM:
an answer one person needs is usually one everybody needs.

## What this study is

We are measuring two things about published virtual-screening models: how well their reported
numbers reproduce from the released artifacts, and how sensitive those numbers are to the exact
composition of the training set. Your job is to produce **trustworthy numbers** for DrugHash.
Interpretation is not your problem; accuracy and honest reporting are.

## Released artifacts

The repository README gives a Google Drive checkpoint and states that training uses PDBBind complexes with LMDB files placed under `train_no_test_af/` — the same layout and the same released data as its predecessor.

## What we already checked for you

The README's Data section says to place the LMDB files under `train_no_test_af/`, which is the predecessor's released training directory. We hold that `train.lmdb` (66,164 records with `smi` and `pocket`) and built the variants from it.

## Notes specific to this model

This model learns binary hash codes and ranks by Hamming distance, so its metric code differs from its predecessor's even though the data is shared. Freeze **its** evaluation path, not the predecessor's.

The README mentions optional HomoAug augmentation. **Do not use it** unless the paper's main results do; if they do, use it identically at B and C and say so.

**The README has no numbers — its results are images.** `published_reference` must come from the paper (AAAI 2025, 39:17041-17049, or arXiv 2407.19790). Do not read a value off `figures/accuracy.png`.

**`test.sh` and `retrieval.sh` ship with the authors' own absolute paths** (`/home/hanj/...`). Replace them. Note also that the LIT-PCBA directory the code reads is `./data/lib-pcba/raw/lit_pcba/` — that spelling is in the source, so create it exactly, and keep the benchmark directories free of stray files, since every entry `os.listdir` returns is treated as a target.

One released checkpoint, `checkpoint_best.pt` under `savedir_drughash/`, and the training script's `--best-checkpoint-metric valid_bedroc --maximize-best-checkpoint-metric` agrees with it: the rule is best-by-`valid_bedroc`. Ignore the `savedir_10_0_s1/` path in `retrieval.sh`; it is not the directory the README tells you to use.

The evaluation inherits `test_dude`, which prints only the macro means, so `per_target.csv` needs the print-only patch described under A2. The benchmark data and the Uni-Mol pretrained weights come from the predecessor's release — if another Uni-Mol model is already set up on this machine, one copy of those is enough. The global batch is 48; keep it the same at B and C.

# Checkpoint A — environment, reproduction, smoke train

**One pull request containing all three parts.** Total cost: under one GPU-hour. Nothing expensive
happens until this is merged.

## A1 — environment  → `A1_env/`

Build the environment the repository asks for, then commit:

| file | content |
|---|---|
| `environment.yml` or `requirements.txt` | the **resolved** versions, not the loose spec |
| `nvidia-smi.txt` | the output, verbatim |
| `import_test.txt` | importing the model package, then printing `torch.__version__`, `torch.version.cuda`, `torch.cuda.is_available()` |
| `summary.json` | `stage` = `"A1_env"` |

Then produce `code/frozen.sha256` — a `sha256sum` listing of the files that compute metrics and load
benchmarks. For this repository that means the retrieval evaluation and its metric code. Err on the side of listing too many files.

**Generate it once, here, and never regenerate it.** CI uses it to detect whether the evaluation
path moved under your feet between checkpoints. If your repository prints only macro means and you
need the per-target dump that contract rule 3 allows, **apply it before you generate this file** —
otherwise the checksum describes code that never scored anything.

### Verify your download now

Your variants are built from the released training file, and the applier checks your copy against
the digest we recorded before it writes anything. Do that check **here**, while it is free:

```bash
python tools/apply_variant.py --check-source <one of your specs> <your released training file>
```

It verifies and exits without writing. Put the digest it prints in `summary.json` under
`environment.source_digest_ok`, or quote it in `REPORT.md`.

Checking at checkpoint A rather than at C is the point: a release that differs from ours fails this
in minutes, instead of after you have paid for a full checkpoint-B run.

**If a pin no longer resolves**, move it to the nearest published release of the same line, record
it in `code/changes.diff` with its one-line justification, and carry on — a pinned pre-release that
has since been removed from PyPI is an index fact, not a change to the model. Do not loosen the pin
to a range, and do not spend hours compiling a source-only package that nothing in the repository
imports: check whether it is imported, and if it is not, drop it and say so. If the package is
imported, or you are unsure, open an issue instead of guessing.

## A2 — reproduce the published numbers  → `A2_reproduce/`   ← hard gate

Score the **released checkpoint** on the benchmarks above, using the repository's own evaluation
script, unmodified.

Then find the matching number **in the paper** and record, in `summary.json` under
`published_reference`: the metric, its value, **which table or section it comes from**, and your
relative gap.

**Name the metric first.** In `summary.json`, `published_reference.metric` is the metric **the paper
itself leads with** for that benchmark, and `published_reference.source` is the table or section it
appears in. Decide that before you compute your gap — the gate applies to the metric you named, so
picking it afterwards would just be choosing whichever number happens to pass.

Mark it: set `published_reference.gate = true` on **exactly one** result. CI rejects zero and
rejects two. Every other benchmark you score still reports its `relative_gap_pct`, and none of them
is gated — so scoring more than you were asked to can never block you.

**The gate is 10 % relative on that metric.** Outside it: open an issue with your evidence and stop.
Do not go on to A3. A documented non-reproduction is a real result and is not your fault.

**If no published number is reachable from published artifacts at all** — the checkpoint the paper
scored was never released, or the benchmark files its evaluator reads were never released — then say
so in `published_reference.blocked` on the gated entry, with which artifact is missing and where you
looked. That entry then passes on the explanation instead of on a gap. Do not reconstruct the
missing artifact from a third-party source and compare that to the paper: a number from a rebuilt
benchmark is not a reproduction, and presenting it as one would be worse than reporting nothing.
Open an issue first either way.

Deliver `summary.json`, `per_target.csv` and `log.txt`.

`per_target.csv` has one row per benchmark target and is **not optional** (contract rule 3).
`target_id`, `n_actives` and `n_total` are always required. The metric columns — `auroc`, `bedroc`,
`ef_0.005`, `ef_0.01`, `ef_0.02`, `ef_0.05` — are required **wherever your model's own evaluation
computes them**; leave a column empty where it does not, and say which in `REPORT.md`. Do not invent
a metric your repository does not compute, and do not quietly substitute a different one.

**Also record the BEDROC alpha your code uses**, as `results[].bedroc_alpha`. Implementations
differ — 80.5 and 85 are both in use — and one is not comparable with the other. Read it out of the
code, do not assume it.

**And record the SHA256 of the checkpoint file you scored.** Some of these repositories load each
other's checkpoints without raising anything at all, so a mix-up produces numbers rather than an
error.

**Two kinds of edit to the evaluation path are allowed**, and only these two: adding a print or a
written row so that per-target numbers come out (contract rule 3 says so already), and registering
the benchmark you were asked to score. They appear in `code/changes.diff` like any other edit, with
a one-line justification in `REPORT.md` (contract rule 2) — do not invent a second patch file, and
do put the diff's sha256 in `summary.json`, which is how CI holds it identical across A2, B and C.
Do not touch how a metric is computed, which molecules are scored, or the order they are scored in
— a patch that changes a number is a different experiment. If you think you need any other change,
open an issue first.

## A3 — smoke train, and the cost estimate  → `A3_smoke/`

Train for **one epoch on a small subset** — a few hundred training groups is plenty. The point is
not a useful model. The point is proof that the training path runs end to end on your machine,
writes a checkpoint, and that the checkpoint loads again.

Deliver `summary.json`, `log.txt`, and in `REPORT.md`:

- how long one epoch took, on what subset
- **your extrapolated cost for checkpoint B, and for each variant in checkpoint C**
- what you extrapolated from
- **what stops a run** — a fixed epoch count, or an early-stopping rule — and where that is
  configured. Several of these repositories set a high epoch cap and rely on early stopping, so
  multiplying your per-epoch time by the cap can overstate the cost many times over, while assuming
  an early stop is a guess. Say which you did.

We approve the expensive runs from that estimate. A careless guess here gets your run either blocked
or wasted.

**Then stop. Open the pull request and wait for it to be merged.**

# Checkpoint B — retrain on the released training data  → `B_retrain_released/`

Only after checkpoint A is merged.

Retrain from scratch on the **released** training data, with the released configuration, a fixed
seed, and the checkpoint selection rule the repository specifies (contract rule 4).

This is the baseline that checkpoint C is compared against. It is half the measurement, not a
formality.

Deliver `summary.json` with `training_data.split_id = "released"`, `per_target.csv`, `log.txt`, and
the checkpoint's SHA256.

In `REPORT.md`, say how your retrained model compares to the released checkpoint you scored at A2.
They are usually **not** identical, and that difference is worth recording rather than hiding.

---

# Checkpoint C — retrain on the supplied variants  → `C_retrain_variants/<variant_id>/`

Only after checkpoint B is merged.

Your variants replace `train.lmdb` inside `train_no_test_af/`.

**You build them yourself from the released data you already have.** We do not send you training
data: a variant differs from the released file only in which records it keeps, so you get a small
spec saying which — tens of kilobytes instead of a gigabyte — and build it locally.

The exact commands for your variants:


**`drugclip_train_ligandish`** — 1 file to build:

```bash
# replaces the released file: train.lmdb
python tools/apply_variant.py \
    splits/specs/drugclip_train_ligandish/drugclip_train_ligandish.json.gz \
    <your released train.lmdb> \
    <where to write it>
```

**`drugclip_train_ligandish_matched`** — 1 file to build:

```bash
# replaces the released file: train.lmdb
python tools/apply_variant.py \
    splits/specs/drugclip_train_ligandish_matched/drugclip_train_ligandish_matched.json.gz \
    <your released train.lmdb> \
    <where to write it>
```

The script verifies your released input against the digest we recorded **before it writes
anything**, and verifies its own output afterwards. Both passing proves your download matches the
input the variant was built from and that the filter applied correctly.

It needs the `lmdb` package only for LMDB specs, which your model already requires.

If a check fails: **stop, do not train, open an issue with the message.** Usually it means your
released download differs from ours, which is itself worth knowing.

Then, for each variant:

1. Retrain with **the same seed, configuration, checkpoint rule and code as checkpoint B**. The input
   file is the only thing that changes (contract rule 6).
2. Record `split_id` in `summary.json`, and one `training_data.files` entry per file you built,
   each with `path` and `content_digest` — the full digest the script printed, not its first
   characters. CI compares every one against `splits/MANIFEST.json` and now rejects a missing
   entry, so list all of your files, not just one.
3. Deliver `C_retrain_variants/<variant_id>/` with `summary.json`, `per_target.csv` and `log.txt`.

## What makes a good submission

Per-target numbers. An empty or fully justified diff. One seed throughout. A stated checkpoint rule
with its source. An honest `Problems` section.

Not a flattering number.
